Description: 
This is my attempt at building an API from a website. It utilizes web scraping, 
assumes an internet connect and access to http://www.scrabblefinder.com, 
scrabblefinder is authored by David Shimoda @scrabblefinder

Please follow the first rule of web-scraping... Don't be a dick.

This could is not intended to be "production-quality" rather it was built to 
practice and learn building APIs to extend website functionality. 
It was directly inspired and motivated by Asheesh Laroia in his wonderful 
PyCon talks.(http://pyvideo.org/)
